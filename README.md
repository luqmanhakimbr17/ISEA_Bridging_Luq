2. Total Cost of Ownership

Printer A – Inkjet
Purchase cost: $120
Ink cartridge cost: $25
Pages per cartridge: 200 pages
Cost per page: $0.125

Printer B – Laser
Purchase cost: $300
Toner cost: $80
Pages per toner: 2,000 pages
Cost per page: $0.04

We assume a typical office prints 500 pages per month.

Over Three Years Comparison:

| Cost Component            | Inkjet (Printer A)       | Laser (Printer B)       |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
|   Upfront cost            | $120                     | $300                    |
|   Monthly print volume    | 500 pages                | 500 pages               |
|   Cost per page           | $0.125                   | $0.04                   |
|   Monthly running cost    | 500 × 0.125 =   $62.50   | 500 × 0.04 =   $20.00   |
|   Yearly operating cost   | $750                     | $240                    |
|   3-year operating cost   | $2,250                   | $720                    |
|   3-year TCO              |   $2,370                 |   $1,020                |

The laser printer has a much lower TCO over 3 years:
Inkjet TCO: $2,370
Laser TCO: $1,020

Even though the laser printer costs more upfront, its lower cost per page results in significant long-term savings.
Therefore, a laser printer is clearly the “best” choice based on TCO. For low printing volume, Inkjet printer is the better choice

Beyond cost, several critical factors affect printer selection:
Print quality (text vs photo printing)
Inkjet: better for photos
Laser: better for office documents

Print speed
Laser printers are significantly faster.

Reliability and duty cycle
Work environments require robust printers capable of high monthly page volumes.

Maintenance and downtime
Laser printers generally require less frequent maintenance
Ink may dry out in low-usage scenarios

Energy consumption
Laser printers use more power when heating toner drums.

Environmental impact
Cartridge recycling
Waste toner
Energy use

Network connectivity
Important for workgroups or shared office environments.

These factors may outweigh pure cost in certain use cases.
